Intelligent System for Brain Hemorrhage Diagnosis
This project implements a deep-learning-based diagnostic system capable of detecting brain hemorrhages from CT scan images. Using a CNN architecture trained on a publicly available brain CT dataset, the model achieves high accuracy in classifying hemorrhage vs. non-hemorrhage cases. Image preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction and contrast enhancement were applied to improve feature extraction. The system provides fast, reliable predictions and can support clinicians in early diagnosis. A simple web interface is included for uploading CT images and obtaining model predictions.
